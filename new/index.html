        <h1>AI should augment human intelligence, not replace it</h1>
        
        <p>How entangled has AI gotten in the matters of human beings? Has AI not become an unavoidable force in the present atmosphere? With each day marking a new achievement for AI, One could surmise that the day when AI will replace human effort altogether is on the horizon. But what if we broaden our perspectives on this matter? What if i told you that there was a whole other way of looking at and dealing with this predicament?

	    <p>It is argued that if workplace-revolutions were to follow the current tragectory, human jobs would be in jeopardy. Although this is possible, it is not desirable. Whilst AI may dominate in computational fields and repetitive tasks, it cannot deal with ambiguity and therefore cannot be impactful on its own. Ever since the advent of the industrial revolution, machines have slowly been supplanting humans. But it is with the introduction of AI, that things have taken a turn for the worse. A lot of creative jobs are being handed over to AI and this has created a lot of uproar within the human race. </p>

        <p>Of late, voice actors and video game actors have raised concerns over AI tools that pose a great danger to their vocation. But there is another side to this coin. Here is an excerpt from an article that provides insight into the other side of the matter.</p>
	
	<p>
	
	“Papercup CEO Jesse Shemen told Fortune that his company “provides a complementary offer to traditional dubbing that unlocks new audiences around the world and supports the growth of creative industries as a whole.
	“Our mission is simple: We want to unlock the 99% of the world’s video content that is trapped in a single language,” he added. “We are proud to work with our network of voice actors, expert translators and A.I. specialists, as we build a product that provides global audiences with high-quality content that would previously never have been localized because of barriers like cost or practicality." 	</p>

	<p>	The article goes onto say how these companies despite their utopian views force voice actors into signing contracts that render them incapable of claiming any rights over their own voice. But if one were to ignore all the dastardly corporate shenanigans, it would become evident how useful AI is in enhancing human capabilities.

        <p>AI powered tools such as Google translate is also an example of AI augmenting human intelligence. These tools help people communicate across different languages. Although the initial translation is done by the AI, It is often refined and reviewed by humans to ensure accuracy and context. 
	</p>

	<p>
	But one has to understand where AI must be used and where it must not be. It has to be used in conjunction with humans and not in place of humans. An AI is simply an algorithm ( a complex set of neural networks ) and it requires some form of input for an output. In corporate settings, constant input is needed given the capricious nature of such spaces. As such, AI must be used judiciously with authentic intelligence. </p>

	    <p>From all of this it is evident that AI cannot function on its own, especially in sectors that require creativity. Another problem with AI is the lack of emotions. In the case of artworks, articles or any other product that hitherto was considered figments of human imagination, emotions play a crucial role. No matter how neutral one attempts to be, there’ll always be hints of emotions somewhere. Although AI artwork seems to have vestiges of emotions, a consequence of using human generated images as input, it cannot challenge the viscerality of authentic human artwork. </p>

	    <p> Both AI and humans have their own merits and these cannot be ignored. By combining humanity’s ability to weather any storm possible with the infallible and inexhaustible computational power, we can definitely change the world for the better. </p>

	    <p> <strong> Ending note: Although, for the sake of the assignment, we had to espouse ideals posited by the essay, we strongly condemn the practise of replacing human workers with AI. Under the facade of efficieny, capitalist overlords try to replace humans, just so that they can have a few more billion dollars to themselves. When our brethren are suffering, to give the only way to climb the capitalistic ladder to an algorithm with no basic neccesities seems very cruel. </strong>  </p>

	    <p><strong>Claim : </strong> AI should augment human intelligence, not replace it. </p>

	    <p><strong>Warrant : </strong> An effective and efficient use of resources for development is always appreciated. </p>

	    <p> <strong>Evidence : </strong> AI can never truly replace human beings as they are incapable of taking into consideration the complexities of morality, culture and emotions. Since AI can use pre existing knowledge and apply it to complete tasks with efficiency and accuracy, to a considerable degree, it is an asset. When human intelligence and AI are utilized in a manner in which they compliment each other, considerable progress is made which goes beyond what is achievable by humans or AI alone.  </p>
