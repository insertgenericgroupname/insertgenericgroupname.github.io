    <section class="post-content">
      <p>The conflicting sentiments behind AI on whether it’ll result in human devastation or development has been going on since the 1920 play &ldquo;Rossum&rsquo;s Universal Robots&rdquo; by Czech writer Karel Čapek, which introduced the word &ldquo;robot&rdquo; to describe artificial workers created by humans. In the play, the robots rebel against their creators and eventually take over the world. Over the years, AI has been grossly misunderstood by many and the conglomerates who understand it want to capitalize AI as a commodity only affordable by the privileged. The essay delves deeper into the subject of AI and it’s future implications examining all the nuances behind the subject. The ultimate conclusion to the age old question,”Will AI replace human beings” has been answered and the answer is a resounding no. Why? Because what we can conclude from every development that has taken place in the field of AI thus far is that it can do “jobs”. It can work. It can complete tasks. But can it evoke emotions? Can it explore human dilemmas? Can it understand emotions in order to explain it? Can it create meaningful art? To a certain degree, it actually can but that remains irrelevant. The ultimate consumers of any product, be it a movie, music or a video game are human beings. Although an AI generated product could be enough to satiate the needs of an average human, Nothing can significantly impact a person’s emotions, perspective and mindset the way human interference can. Without human interference, AI can never venture beyond what already exists. AI may be able to work with already existing ideas and sentiments and generate matter faster than a human being can but It is the human mind that explores the unknown and brings about the existence of new ideologies and sentiments that can effectively and significantly shape the world. When sentiments and emotions are manipulated by the human mind to convey something novel, thought is provoked. And the world is meaningless without constant novelties being introduced. Without discovery, development will become stagnant and the world becomes repetitive. So human beings and AI must compliment each other in order to bring into existence a developing world.</p>
